# Species Distribution Modeling
The codes for modeling species distribution have been placed in this repository. Separate folders have been created for each analysis. Each of these folders contains the script and associated data files. The premise for each analysis has been explained at the beginning of each script. The repository now contains the following:
1. Downloading bioclimatic variables, processing occurrence and climate data, selection of variables (sdm1)
2. Niche characterization (sdm2)
3. Testing of model transferability (sdm3)
4. Modelling distribution of an invasive species (sdm4)
5. Modelling distribution of a true mangrove species (sdm5)
The data files for sdm1, sdm4 and sdm5 are available at:
